Allows Super Admins to control which themes are visible to admins of a given site within a multi-site WordPress environment.

== Description ==

The Theme Visibility Manager adds granular administrative control over which themes are visible in the themes menu for any given site. Themes can be made hidden or visible on a blog by blog basis (through the themes menu) or on a site-wide basis through the 'Theme Visibility Manager' page in the Super Admin menu.

Themes can be active even if they are invisible, but this can only be controlled by Super Admins. Blog administrators only have control over visible themes.

If you find this theme useful, you might also like the Plugin Visibility Manager.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `theme-visibility-manager` director to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Network Activate the theme through the 'plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I make a theme Visible/Hidden in a site? =

If you are a Super Admin, navigate to the themes page in the admin section. Each theme will have its visibility status (i.e. 'is Visible' or 'is Hidden'). Next to this is a link ('make visible' or 'make hidden'). Clicking on this link will change the status of this theme in the current site.

= How do I make a theme Visible/Hidden site-wide? =

Navigate to the 'Themes Visibility Manager' page in the 'Super Admin' menu. From there, find the theme in question and click on 'Globally Show' or Globally Hide' as necessary. You can hide/show multiple themes at once by using the check boxes and the 'Show Globally' or 'Hide Globally' buttons at the bottom of the page.

Note: Hiding/Showing a lot of themes consumes a lot of memory and may require refreshing the page for it to work (or not work at al). If this is an issue, just select a few plugins at a time.
