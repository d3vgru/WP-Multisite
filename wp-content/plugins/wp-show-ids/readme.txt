***Special instructions for Multisite Blog Farms:** If you're installing this plugin on WordPress® with Multisite/Networking enabled, and you run a Blog Farm ( i.e. you give away free blogs to the public ); please `define("MULTISITE_FARM", true);` in your /wp-config.php file. When this plugin is running on a Multisite Blog Farm, it will mutate itself ( including its menus ) for safe compatiblity with Blog Farms. You don't need to do this unless you run a Blog Farm.
