= How to use: nivo_slider, jcarousel, custom_gallery =
With these shortcodes you can create different galleries from attached to post images, or from category posts.

Way 1: gallery from attachments

* Create new post
* Upload images
* Use next shortcode on pages, posts or even widgets

`[nivo_slider source="post=XX" link="image"]`

XX - ID of the post with uploaded images

Way 2: gallery from category

* Create some posts in some category
* Set the thumbnails of posts
* Use next shortcode on pages, posts or even widgets

`[nivo_slider source="cat=XX" link="image"]`

XX - ID of the category with new posts

Also, you can use [jcarousel] and [custom_gallery] according these principles.
