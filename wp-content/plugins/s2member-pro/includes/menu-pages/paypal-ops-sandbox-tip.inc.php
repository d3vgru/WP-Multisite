Then, create a new PayPal® Pro Seller account inside the Sandbox; with PayPal® Pro enabled - which requires a special, yet "fake" application. Whenever you fill out the fake Pro-Application, be sure to start your Social Security # with <code>111</code>, and then use whatever random numbers you prefer. You\'ll need to configure s2Member with your Sandbox API Credentials, and supply a Sandbox email address that is tied to a PayPal® Pro Sandbox account. Once you have all of that, you can add a fake credit card to any Personal Sandbox account ( that is, a Buyer account ). Log out of your WordPress® Dashboard before testing. You can use your fake card number &amp; expiration date for running test transactions as a would-be Customer.</em></p>' . "\n";
