This setting only affects PayPal® Pro Forms that use a `Subscription` configuration with an immediate charge. In other words, if your PayPal® Pro Form is configured to bill on a recurring basis ( starting the day of signup ), this setting controls the way in which s2Member handles the first payment of the Customer\\\'s Paid Subscription ( aka: Recurring Profile ).\\n\\nWe recommend: `Consolidate w/ Recurring Profile`, because this keeps all charges associated with a particular Customer organized in your PayPal® account. No matter which option you choose, a first Initial Payment ( when applicable ), will always be charged immediately. However, in cases where it is critical that a Customer NOT gain access until their first payment has been fully captured, choose: `Real-Time / Direct Pay`, which tells s2Member to authorize/capture the first payment in real-time during checkout, instead of consolidating it into the Recurring Profile.\\n\\nHere Is A Breakdown For You\\n\\n— Consolidate w/ Recurring Profile —\\ns2Member creates a Recurring Profile with an Initial Payment amount, to be charged immediately. PayPal® generates the Recurring Profile, returns a successful response to s2Member and the Customer gains access. Moments later ( usually within 30 seconds ), PayPal® will authorize/capture the first payment. If the first payment is declined, s2Member will revoke the Customer\\\'s access immediately.\\n\\n— Real-Time / Direct Pay ( mission critical ) —\\ns2Member charges the first payment separately ( in real-time during checkout ), leaving no possibility for the Customer to gain access until the first charge is fully captured. A Recurring Profile is also generated, which handles any future billing. You will have two billing records in your PayPal® account. One for the Initial Payment, and another for the Recurring Profile.\'); return false;">full details</a> ]' . "\n";
