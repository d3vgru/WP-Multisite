In the fields below, you can set a Global Default Tax Rate, and/or a "Custom Tax Configuration File"; which can be applied to specific countries, specific states, provinces, and even to specific zip code ranges. * Tax Rate calculations are fully compatible with international currencies and locations.</p>' .

The calculated Tax Rate is added to the <em>Charge Amount</em> in your PayPal® Pro Shortcode. The Tax Rate will be displayed to a Customer during checkout, <strong>after</strong> they\'ve supplied a Billing Address. For example, if you create a PayPal® Pro Form that charges a Customer <strong>$24.95</strong>, and the Tax Rate is configured as 7.0%; s2Member will automatically calculate the Tax as $1.75. A Customer will pay the Total Amount ( <em>Charge</em> + Tax = <strong>$26.70</strong> ).</p>' . "\n";
