If you\'re using a single PayPal® Pro account for multiple cross-domain installations, and you need to receive IPN notifications for each of your domains; you\'ll want to create a central IPN processing script that scans variables in each IPN response, forking itself out to each of your individual domains. In rare cases when this is necessary, you\'ll find two variables in all IPN responses for s2Member. The originating domain name ( i.e. <code>' . esc_html ($_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"]) .

These variables can be used to test incoming IPNs, and fork to the proper installation.
