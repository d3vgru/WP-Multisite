We\'ve <strong>excluded</strong> this functionality on purpose, because many site owners prefer to use a more comprehensive CAPTCHA plugin that encompasses all aspects of their site. We recommend <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/" target="_blank" rel="external">this one</a>. <strong>However</strong>, s2Member Pro Forms for PayPal® Pro and Authorize.Net® <em>( including Free Registration Forms )</em> CAN be configured with s2Member, to use Google\'s reCAPTCHA™ service <em>( which is free )</em>. Just add this Attribute to your Pro Form Shortcode: <code>captcha="clean"</code>.</p>' . "\n";
						echo '<p><strong>Regarding s2Member Pro Forms.</strong> s2Member comes with a default set of reCAPTCHA™ Keys, both Public and Private. If you leave the fields below empty, s2Member will simply use its own default set of Keys for reCAPTCHA™. However, if you\'re using s2Member Pro Forms, we DO suggest that you acquire your own set of reCAPTCHA™ Keys <em>( it\'s free )</em>. It\'s better to have your own set of Keys, specifically for your domain. Please follow <a href="http://www.s2member.com/recaptcha-create-keys" target="_blank" rel="external">this link</a> to obtain Public/Private Keys for the reCAPTCHA™ service.</p>' . "\n";
