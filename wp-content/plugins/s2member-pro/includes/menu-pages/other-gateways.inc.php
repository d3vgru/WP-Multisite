If you\'d like to use them all, you can! Just remember, for each Payment Gateway that you integrate, you must configure the options for that Gateway, and you must use s2Member\'s Button Generator to create WordPress® Shortcodes that go into your Membership Options Page <em>( aka: your Signup Page )</em>.</p>' .
