If you don't have pictures in your posts, it is probably best to go with text only. Try out both and see what each looks like on your site. Switching back and forth is easy.","nrelate"),

If you do not set a default image, for posts with no image we will display a random license free image from our database. Setting a default image is highly recommended.","nrelate"),

If you want to show more than one row of thumbnail links, just select a higher number here. Note: If you are showing links to partner sites/and or advertisers, these links will be included in this number. For example, if you select 10 posts, 2 Partner links, and 2 Ad links, your posts will show a total of 10 links (6 Post links, 2 Partner links and 2 Ad links).","nrelate"),

If you write more &#34;evergreen&#34; content, it is best to make this setting go back at least as many years as your site has been around.
